I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en.html">Comparative Linguistics Department<a> at the University of ZÃ¼rich, an external affiliate of the <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/DLCE-research-overview">Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution<a> at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the <a href="http://hraf.yale.edu/">Human Relations Area Files<a>  at Yale University.<br/> <br/> My primary interest is understanding the relation between human behaviour and linguistic diversity, in particular in relation to recent human evolution. I combine data science with insights and (observational) data from linguistic typology, evolutionary anthropology, ethnography and the cognitive sciences.
