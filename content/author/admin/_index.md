I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en.html">Comparative Linguistics Department</a>  at the University of ZÃ¼rich (Switzerland) and a research affiliate of the <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/DLCE-research-overview">Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution</a> at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena (Germany), where I am also an external faculty to the <a href="https://imprs.shh.mpg.de/">IMPRS Ph.D. program</a>. I also hold two external positions: research associate to the <a href="http://hraf.yale.edu/">Human Relations Area Files</a>  at Yale University (USA) and senior researcher at the Quantitative Linguistics Laboratory in Kazan Federal University (Russia).

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences</a> while simultaneously I held an affiliation to the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/index.html">Department of Linguistics</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, both institutes from Leipzig (Germany). I obtained my B.Sc. in Physics and M.Sc. in Statistical Physics from the <a href="http://www.ib.edu.ar/component/k2/item/132-instituto-balseiro.html"> Balseiro Institute</a> in Bariloche (Argentina).
