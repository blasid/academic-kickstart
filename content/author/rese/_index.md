My primary interest is understanding the relation between human behaviour and linguistic diversity, in particular in relation to recent human evolution. I combine data science with insights and (observational) data from linguistic typology, evolutionary anthropology, ethnography and the cognitive sciences.

My most recent research ranges from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0192-4">emergence of creole languages</a>, word order patterns, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10818">form-meaning associations</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/5/1322">the adaptation of the speech apparatus</a> and the prehistory of worldwide linguistic diversity.
